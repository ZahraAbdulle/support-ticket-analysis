- Analysis of ticket categories, response times, and resolution patterns
- Visualizations to identify trends and key insights

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib`
2. Open the Jupyter notebook `Final Coursework 2 Combined.ipynb` and run all cells.

## Repository Contents
- **Final Coursework 2 Combined.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the complete analysis and visualizations.
- **support2-1.csv**: Dataset containing anonymized support ticket data.

## Dataset
The dataset `support2-1.csv` is included for replicating the analysis. It contains anonymized support ticket data, including ticket categories, timestamps, and resolution statuses.
